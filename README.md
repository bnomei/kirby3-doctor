  doctor:
    type: doctor
    label: Perform checks
    # progress: Performing checks...
```

```js
let doctor = fetch('https://kirby3-plugins.bnomei.com/api/plugin-doctor/check')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(json => {
      console.log(json);
  });
```

## Provided Checks

- CheckPHPVersion (laminas): Kirby installation requirements
- CheckPHPExtension (laminas): Kirby installation requirements
- CheckKirbyFolders (laminas): Read/Write-Access to core Kirby folders
- CheckGitFolder: No public `.git` folder
- CheckHtaccess: Has a `.htaccess` file
- CheckKirbyAccount: Has at least one account
- CheckKirbyCacheSize: Cache folder not too big
- CheckKirbyLicense: License exists (on non localhost)
- CheckKirbyMediaSize: Media folder not too big
- CheckKirbySystem: Kirby build-in system checks

## Custom Checks

You can add custom checks or disable build checks using the `checks` setting in the config file.

```
return [
    'bnomei.doctor.checks' => [
        "MyNamespace\\MyClass" => true, // enable new
        "Bnomei\\CheckKirbyCacheSize" => false, // disable build-in
    ],
    // ...
];
```

You can also use your own plugin to define checks (since 1.2.0). Many thanks to @fabianmichael for the great idea.
```
Kirby::plugin('my/plugin', [        // your plugin
  'bnomei.doctor.checks' => [       // required option id
    "MyNamespace\\MyClass" => true, // enable new
  ],
]);
```
